## What is XinFin?
XinFin is an hybrid blockchain that aims to bridge the global infrastructure and trade deficit using real world compatible
Hybrid Blockchain Platform to enable inFinite eXchange of values.

### 1. XDC Protocol
XinFin Network is powered by XDC Protocol, the native fuel driven protocol to interact with XinFin Network.
XDC Protocol Facilitates:
  1. Interoperability between any kind of assets deployed on XinFin Private Network
  2. Transaction Confirmation/sending on Public network through private network
  3. Interledger transfer between any kind of assets deployed on public blockchainnetwork of private network using XDC 
  Protocol as communication channel

### 2. TradeFinex
  1. Peer to Peer Trade and Finance Platform
  2. Buyers and Sellers prove credibility with third party and distributed Credit Data 
  3. Buyers and Sellers can create instruments of purchase/transactions/invoices
  4. Instruments can be traded/factored in secondary markets
  5. Allows access through Open Restful APIS

### 3. iFactor
Allows Creation and Factoring of Invoices

### 4. alphaex.net
  1. Digital Assets Exchange
  2. Trade Settlement Engine
  3. Cash-in/Cash-out using FIAT currencies
  4. FX Settlements
  5. Interledger Transfer between Assets
  6. Accessible through Open RESTFUL APIS

### 5. MyContract.co
Creates tokenization of any Kind of asset classes like community coins, Bonds, real estate, infrastructure

## What can you #BUILDwithXinFin?

### Instant token swaps
Embed simple and atomic ERC20 <-> ERC20 token swaps in your application.

### Single Step Payments
Expand your payment options for your users by accepting not just ETH, but ERC20 tokens too. Empower your users with the freedom of choice in pay in their favourite tokens. [Peepeth](https://peepeth.com/a/crowdfunding) and [Etheremon](https://hackernoon.com/etheremon-integrates-with-kybers-on-chain-liquidity-protocol-a-new-payment-solution-for-ccbb36dfd595) are but some examples.

### On-chain Fund Rebalancing
Achieve seamless liquidation of assets for immediate rebalancing of portfolios in a single transaction. Take a look at [b0x](https://b0x.network/) for a glimpse of what is possible!

### Arbitrage Programs
Take advantage of market inefficiencies, since prices are not always the same across different price discovery venues, especially between off-chain and on-chain prices. Help improve price equilibrium across the market whilst profiting from it!

If you need more ideas on what you can build, take a look at the bounties below!



## Prizes
Stand to win up to 300000 INR worth of XDC tokens for the themed bounty. The official Relay-Bridge and DPoS prize (Open Category) has a higher prize pool of 200000 INR worth of XDC tokens!

## Judging Criteria
### 1. Idea
The importance of XDC protocol in the application, & originality of the idea.

### 2. User Experience
Intuitive, easy to use and interact with.

### 3. Technical Difficulty
Going above and beyond of what we specified. Good code quality, bug free, with thorough documentation.

### 4. Usability
Other projects are able to build on top of your application, or incorporate it into their own.

### 5. X Factor
Something that makes us go "Wow!"
