# Project Name: MedRec

## Description: A web platform where medical data of patients is stored on a distributed ledger or Blockchain. The patients would be the decision maker in deciding who can gain access to his medical data, whether it is the hospital, insurance company or the researchers. This will help reduce the forging of medical data and fake incurrence of expenses that patients have to face due to data breach. We have tried to use IPFS for storing the images of prescriptions and scanned reports.

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed ):

* JavaScript
* Ethereum
* Solidity
* Truffle
* Ganache-CLI
* Metamask
* XDC Blockchain

languages, frameworks, libraries etc. with their need & purpose

* JavaScript
* Solidity
* React Native

## Limitations: The app won't allow research people to gather data of the patient yet since there's debate on ethical use of medical data for research. The app is currently limited to web app and hence mobile accessibility would be an issue. We look forward to bring the web app to mobile in near future.


## Future Aspects
* This platform currently connects patients with hospitals, insurance companies and government. However, another pillar that is missing from this network is the research field.
* The use of medical data for research is a topic of debate, since it involves the factor of ethics and authentic use.
* With more authenticity layers and verification, the research segment could be added, whereby the researchers, after verification and license agreement, can be allowed by patient to access his/her data for research purpose.
