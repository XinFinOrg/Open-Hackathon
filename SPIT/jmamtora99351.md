# BMusic

## Description
A System that uses the concept of blockchains to facilitate unique and authentic transactions in the field of music, primarily aiming to protect artists' revenues and intellectual rights.
Basically this application takes the user to the login page where the address hash is entered and verified. After verifying, user is able to search the desired song. If song is availabe then using the smart contract, user can buy the song and stream it on demand.
If the song is already purchased by the buyer, then a prompt is given indicating as such.

## Functions
Login, to register the user address. Search, to search the extant database for desired songs. Check, on each page to check the user address. Buy, to purchase and gain streaming access to songs.

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed )
This project implements blockchain built through Solidity, linked to a local hosted website. The website harnesses blockchain through web3.js, and emulated by Ganache (blockchain simulator) and Meta Mask (ethereum accounts).

## Languages, frameworks, libraries etc. with their need & purpose
Solidity for the Blockchain, CSS & HTML for the web portal, Javascript for web functionality, web3.js as connector between blockchain and website, Ganache as a virtual blockchain emulator, Truffle as blockchain framework, Remix online IDE for Solidity, Meta Mask for ethereum account, Notepad++ & VSCode as code editors.

## Limitations
Small scale proof of concept showing only some of the features that can make it a completely self sufficient end user product. Current stage of blockchain adoption among average consumers is very low, further exacerbating the time taken to mainstream this service with its full functionality.

## Future Aspects
Apart from the current iteration which endeavours to prevent receiving side piracy by sourcing all songs from the blockchain platform, future versions can even verify whether uploads to the platform are original or pirated, so that piracy is eliminated right at the source.
Moreover, parallel applications can scan user libraries to check for unauthorised downloads from other sources, thus completely eliminating piracy. This is unique in the respect that blockchains enable each track to have a unique immutable signature, hence preventing frauds involving minor modifications to skirt anti-piracy measures.
